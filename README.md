## Running the Project
1. Install the latest version of node and clone the repo
2. Run `npm i` to install all the necessary packages
3. Run `npm start` to start the project

## Git
We are all working on the same project, so we are 
going to need to use branching with Git.
1. Create a new branch with `git checkout -b (branchName)`
2. Stage your changes for commit `git add .`
3. Commit your changes `git commit -m "message"`
4. Push your changes to the repository `git push`

I will review changes and if they are approved, I will merge it with the master branch.

Note: Before adding files to Git, run `npm run format` to format your code
so it looks nice.
